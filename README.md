it's deeply inspired by [la linea](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VWcqILJam4)

it's based on angle changes, so the animation has a funky / strange quality where the line is constantly uncurlign and recurling itself. 

the code is not clean by any stretch of the imagination, and it was a quick port to OF, but I'll try to update it.
